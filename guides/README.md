# Guides
A collection of stand-alone documentation and guides used for creating the NB-models. We use this for documenting our work, but we also hope that it can be useful for other working on similar topics. 

## Specifications
* [Internal jsonl-format](text_extraction_format.md)

## Dataset Creation
* [Exporting dataset to HuggingFace](creating_huggingface_dataset.md)
* [Processing MC4 (obsolete)](prepare_common_crawl.md)
* [Publish Tensorflow Checkpoints on HuggingFace](publish_checkpoint.md)

## Setting up Training Environment
* [Guide for setting up Flax and training RoBERTa, T5 and GPTNeo](flax.md)
* [Create Google Cloud VM, bucket and TPU](create_vm_bucket_tpu_tensorflow.md)
* [Setting up a standard Google Cloud VM](configure_vm_tensorflow.md)

## Tensorflow
