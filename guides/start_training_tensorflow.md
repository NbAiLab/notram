# Training Tensorflow

Currently this requires Tensorflow 2.2 and Python 3.8. With the newest conda there is a few errors. Run the following:
```bash
pip install numpy==1.19.5
pip install tensorflow-addons==0.10.0
  ```
  
# Start training
If you have read [Setting up Machines for Training](https://github.com/NBAiLab/notram/blob/master/setting_up_machines_for_training.md) and [Set up Notram VM](https://github.com/NBAiLab/notram/blob/master/set_up_vm.md), you should be ready to start the training.

The training script located in the covid-twitter-bert can be run directly. It does however have have quite a few parameters, and these might be useful to store for later. We therefore recommend creating a shell script called "run1.sh" with the parameters and running this script instead.

If you have followed the guide earlier, the paths to the bucket should now be correct.

```bash
RUN_PREFIX=first_experiment #Prefix that is used on all training. Up to you what to put here. Makes it easier to identify runs.
PROJECT_NAME=notram_v1 #First level in the bucket. Where all the files are kept
BUCKET_NAME=notram-myzone #Set bucket name
TPU_IP=10.113.99.154 #Replace with the internal IP of your TPU. When training on pods, use tpu_name instead
PRETRAIN_DATA=corpus1 #Subdirectory where the training data is held
MODEL_CLASS=bert_large_cased_wwm #This name needs to exist in the file called config.py. File should be self explanatory
TRAIN_BATCH_SIZE=1024 #Maximum size depends on seq_length. On a v3-8 we should go for max size. Should be dividable by 8
NUM_EPOCHS=3 #Not to be confused with real epochs. This is the time between each round, and will finish when writing a checkpoint
MAX_SEQ_LENGTH=128 #Sequence length is set when creating tfrecord-files and can not be changed here
MAX_PREDICTIONS_PER_SEQ=19 #Set this to the same value as the one used when creating the tfrecords files
LEARNING_RATE=1e-4 #1e-4 is a recommended learning rate when training from scratch with this batch size. Reduce for domain specific pre-training and scale with batch size
END_LEARNING_RATE=1e-4 #Set to the same as the start learning_rate here. Typically we would however decrease it to 0
STEPS_PER_LOOP=100 #Not critical. Leave like this
NUM_STEPS_PER_EPOCH=10000 #Mainly for calculating when the checkpoints should be written, and what should internally be considered an epoch
WARMUP_STEPS=500 #Lineary increases learning rate during warmup. Important especially when training from scratch
OPTIMIZER_TYPE=adamw #This is the correct choice here. However, when training on pods and huge batch sizes, change this to lamb

  It is strongly recommended to run all training inside of tmux. If not, the training might be interrupted by the closing of your terminal. This command starts a new tmux-session called "run1". You can detach from it with "ctl-b d", and reattach with "tmux a -t run1". It is usually no problem running a few training sessions on different TPUs on a single VM.
  ```bash
  tmux new -s run1
  ```
  
  Since you have stored the script in the file 'run1.sh' you can now start it easily with:
  ```bash
  sh run1.sh
  ```
