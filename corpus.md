* **Periodicas** - Published between ??. A wide range of periodicas and yearbooks. Mostly OCR scans.
* **Legal** - LovData CD (200?) and LovData DVD (200?). This is a complete collection of all verdicts prior to these dates. The collection is originally OCR scanned but after that manually corrected.
